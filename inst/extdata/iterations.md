**em_iter**:

number of iterations performed to estimate the hiper-hiper parameters of signeR model. Ignored if previously computed values are used for those parameters (fast option).

**warm**:

number of Gibbs sampler iterations performed in warming phase, before signeR assumes that the model have converged.

**eval**:

number of final Gibbs sampler iterations used to estimate signatures and exposures.
