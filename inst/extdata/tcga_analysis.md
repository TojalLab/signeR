### Description of analysis

Instead of uploading a private dataset, here signeRFlow allows the user to explore exposure data previously estimated for samples on TCGA public datasets. 

The signeR algorithm was previously applied to genome samples from 33 cancer types and estimated mutational signatures and exposures were obtained for each type. 

Also, known signatures from the Cosmic database were fitted to TCGA mutation data, thus estimating related exposures on each cancer type. 

Please select the cancer type of interest and the analysis type on the left box. Optionally, samples can be filtered according to available features shown in the data summary below.
