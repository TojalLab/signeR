### Description of analysis

The algorithmâ€™s intensive computations were performed previously for the dataset from each cancer type, running both the de novo analysis and the fitting to Cosmic signatures. 

On both cases, estimated exposure data can be visualized and explored. 

Instead of uploading a private dataset, here signeRFlow allows the user to explore exposure data previously estimated for samples on TCGA public datasets. 

The signeR algorithm were previously applied to genome samples from 33 cancer types and estimated mutational signatures and exposures   were obtained for each type. Also, known signatures from Cosmic database were fitted to TCGA mutation data, thus estimating related exposures on each cancer type. 

Please select the cancer type of interest and the analysis type on the left box. Optionally, samples can be filtered according to available features shown in the data summary below.
