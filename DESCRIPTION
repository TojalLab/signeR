Description: The signeR package provides an empirical Bayesian approach
        to mutational signature discovery. It is designed to analyze
        single nucleotide variaton (SNV) counts in cancer genomes, but
        can also be applied to other features as well. Functionalities
        to characterize signatures or genome samples according to
        exposure patterns are also provided.
